## Faq

Q. Will you make in game exploits?
<br>
A. No, because that would be breaking Blooket ToS.
<br>
<br>
Q. Will my account be suspended for using these?
<br>
A. No, as long as you are not spamming the API or breaking ToS you will not be suspended.
<br>
<br>
Q. Can I use this on android/ios and how do I?
<br>
A. For IOS please view the IOS/Apple section of this file, for Android/Samsung/Google OS please view the bookmarklet section.
<br>
<br>
Q. When I use any of the Blook scripts, it always gets messed up and displays some info twice. How do i fix this?
<br>
A. Before running the script on the Blooks page, make sure you click on a non-common blook. This happens because the common blooks do not start with a sell price, messing things up.
<br>
<br>
Q. On the export scripts, it always says something goes wrong and fails to copy to clipboard.
</br>
A. This is due to the mozilla clipboard api not being supported on safari, it currently detects anything wrong as an issue and will always download file.
