# **NOTICE**
#### Blooket has started to take action on accounts that spam the api too fast. 
#### If you are worried about anything happening to your account while using these, read this section and the FAQ.
#### As long as you are using them only as they're meant to be used you will not be suspended.
#### I have gotten confirmation that none of these will disable your account, so do not worry

## Faq

Q. Will you make in game exploits?
</br>
A. No, because that would be breaking Blooket ToS.
</br>
</br>
Q. Will my account be suspended for using these?
</br>
A. No, as long as you are not spamming the API or breaking ToS you will not be suspended.
</br>
</br>
Q. Can I use this on android/ios and how do I?
</br>
A. For IOS please view the IOS/Apple section of this file, for Android/Samsung/Google OS please view the bookmarklet section.
</br>
</br>
Q. Is this ever going to get taken down?
</br>
A. Until I am required to by Blooket ToS this repo will stay public.
</br>
</br>
Q. Can the python be run on any os?
</br>
A. The Python section has only been tested on Windows, Repl.it and IOS Pythonista3. It should work on Linux and other systems but it has not been tested.
</br>
</br>
Q. When I use any of the Blook scripts, it always gets messed up and displays some info twice. How do i fix this?
</br>
A. Before running the script on the Blooks page, make sure you click on a non-common blook. This happens because the common blooks do not start with a sell price, messing things up.
</br>
</br>
Q. Why is the code obfuscated?
</br>
A. I obfuscate the code for many reasons, many of them are to respect other blooket community developer's wishes, others are for my own reasons.
</br>
</br>
Q. On the export scripts, it always says something goes wrong and fails to copy to clipboard.
</br>
A. This is due to the mozilla clipboard api not being supported on safari, it currently detects anything wrong as an issue and will always download file.
